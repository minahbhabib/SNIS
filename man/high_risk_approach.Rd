\arguments{
\item{num_of_ind}{The number of individuals to randomly select from riskiest people dataset.}

\item{coercion_factor}{Behavior increment to boost behavior by. Regardless of number, individuals will be capped at 1.}

\item{riskiest_ppl_dataset}{Requires output dataset from riskiest_ppl function.}

\item{dataset}{A dataset set up so that variable 1 is ID, variable 2 is behavior at time 0 (0-1 scale by fixed intervals), variable 3 is the close ties response, and variable 4 is the weak ties response. Total of 4 variables.}

\item{close_matrix}{A unidirectional or bidirectional adjacency matrix. Values are either 0 or 1 to represent connections.}

\item{sim_max}{A value at which to limit the simulation. Warning, it may never reach that value if values do not improve from t to t+1.}

\item{bhv_increment}{The increments at which your behavior variable increases. It is a constant value.}

\item{CT_attribution_fraction}{The weight of close ties.}

\item{WT_attribution_fraction}{The weight of weak ties.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataset, labeled ndata, to the global environment with simulation results.
}
\description{
